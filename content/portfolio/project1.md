# Project 1: Website Redesign

## Overview

This project involved redesigning a client's website to improve user experience and modernize the visual design.

## Challenge

The client's existing website was outdated, not mobile-friendly, and had poor navigation that made it difficult for users to find information.

## Solution

I created a responsive design with a clean, minimalist aesthetic that works well on all devices. The new navigation structure makes it easy for users to find what they're looking for.

## Results

- 40% increase in mobile traffic
- 25% decrease in bounce rate
- 15% increase in average session duration

## Technologies Used

- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript
- Figma for design
- Responsive design principles
